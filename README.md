## Description

Goal was to create a weather dashboard where you can search for a city and have it pop up. It will give you the current and future weather predictions. 
The city name, date, and an icon representing the weather will show with the 5-day forecast below it.
UV index will show weather it's low, moderate, or severe conditions.
